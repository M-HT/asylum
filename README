SDL Asylum
==========

Young Sigmund has a few problems. To help him resolve his mental instability
you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down the
malfunctioning brain cells. 

A port of Andy Southgate's 1994 platform shooter for the Acorn Archimedes.

Installation
============

	sudo make install

You'll need SDL and SDL_mixer.  If you don't have (or don't want to be) root,
modify the Makefile to point at directories you have write access to.

Instructions
============

See the file 'Instruct' for the instructions included with the original game.
Since they're remarkably little help, let me add that the default keys are
Z, X, ;, . and that pressing the Down key when standing on a teleporter
enables you to teleport.

Licensing
=========

SDL Asylum is distributed under GPL version 3.  The original game music
and graphics are © Andy Southgate 1993, and were placed in the public domain
by Andy Southgate in 2002.
